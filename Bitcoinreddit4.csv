\#1

[https://www.qr-code-generator.com/solutions/bitcoin-qr-code/](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/solutions/bitcoin-qr-code/)

**Review:** Newer site, but at the time of this writing, appears to generate a legitimate QR-code based on your address, but it won't let you download the qr-code without a user account.

&amp;#x200B;

\#2

[www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/)

**Review:** *THIS SITE IS A TOTAL SCAM!*  It's been identified as such by another reddit user 7 months ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/li39mb/psa\_httpswwwbitcoinqrcodemakercom\_may\_be\_scamming/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/li39mb/psa_httpswwwbitcoinqrcodemakercom_may_be_scamming/)

It's also implemented advanced address mimicking software, designed to mimic the first several characters of the Bitcoin address you input.

This same scam site appears as the #1 result of a Bing search, and the #2 result of a duckduckgo search.

&amp;#x200B;

\#3

[https://gobitcoin.io/tools/qrcode/](https://gobitcoin.io/tools/qrcode/)

This site is legitimate and has been around for a while, but does not correctly verify Bech-32 addresses and has ads cluttering the user experience.  It does however support some of the Bitcoin URI payment specification and also verifies non-Bech32 Bitcoin addresses. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#4

[https://www.budgetcoinz.com/qr-code-generator/](https://www.budgetcoinz.com/qr-code-generator/)

Appears to be legit, but doesn't perform any address check to ensure that user is entering a valid address.

&amp;#x200B;

\#5

[https://games647.github.io/BitcoinQRCode/](https://games647.github.io/BitcoinQRCode/)

Also appears legit, but also does not perform any Bitcoin address verification check.

&amp;#x200B;

\#6

[https://www.zdnet.com/article/network-of-fake-qr-code-generators-will-steal-your-bitcoin/](https://www.zdnet.com/article/network-of-fake-qr-code-generators-will-steal-your-bitcoin/)

A news story published last year documenting the bitcoin qr-code scamming problem.

&amp;#x200B;

\#7

[https://www.cwaqrgen.com/](https://www.cwaqrgen.com/)

A legit site that's been around for a while: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8fh5eo/crypto\_wallet\_address\_qr\_generator/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8fh5eo/crypto_wallet_address_qr_generator/)

All around, a decent site, but doesn't support Bitcoin address verification or the Bitcoin URI payment specification (BIP 0021).

&amp;#x200B;

\#8 and #9

A couple more news articles on QR code generators for Bitcoin

&amp;#x200B;

\#10

Wiki page on QR code generating for Bitcoin.

[https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/QR\_Code\_Generator](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/QR_Code_Generator)

&amp;#x200B;

Now the above analysis was only done for Google results.  If you search on duckduckgo or bing, the results are even worse, with numerous scams charting the top results.

&amp;#x200B;

A couple years ago, a couple friends and I built a legitimate site specifically tailored to Bitcoin to address this problem:

[https://qrcode4bitcoin.com/](https://qrcode4bitcoin.com/)

but it still has no SEO ranking.

&amp;#x200B;

We announced it on reddit and it was well received:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/c0odsw/we\_built\_an\_adfree\_scamfree\_bitcoin\_qr\_code/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/c0odsw/we_built_an_adfree_scamfree_bitcoin_qr_code/)

The site we created is (as far as I'm aware) still the most capable and secure Bitcoin QR code generator on the internet.  It also operates without any ads or monitoring of users and the source code is transparent.

&amp;#x200B;

What confuses me is why the site we built remains such an utter failure (in terms of search engine rankings) and why websites that are total scams continue to top the charts despite many news outlets continuing to report on this very problem.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; In his speech, the President directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. Companies could face thousands of dollars in fines per employee if they don't comply. 

Basically, the employer gets fined every week they have unvaccinated employees on the payroll. In other words, if you don't get the jab, you get fired.

This would effectly put an end to the delta variant, which would allow the federal reserve to finally begin tapering.

Maths: 

80 years - your current age = years remaining

$100,000 per year x years remaining = freedom money

Bitcoin = $50,000…..and appreciates 200% per year on average

As such, assume you are:

Age 20 = 60 years remaining —&gt; need ???
Age 25 = 55 years remaining —&gt; need ???
Age 30 = 50 years remaining —&gt; need ???
Age 35 = 45 years remaining —&gt; need 8 BTC

But the guy mentions some other stuff

1. Having to be physically present at WU office: transportation costs (long bus ride)
2. Being robbed: when these people take the bus to the city, people know they are going to pick up money
3. The sender having to go to a WU office (maybe they can do a bank transfer but that costs money)
4. WU can take 3 days (wow)

So I wonder if the 400 million is only WU fees and it does not take into account the what seems like substantial expenses besides these fees? How much is using btc costing? Do people use Lightning typically? If they only used btc without Lightning, are fees very high nowadays?

A sort of cynical point is, the receiver being robbed does not mean the money leaves the country but it is obviously a huge incentive for the receiver to use btc rather than WU.";27;0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/pl3vdv/an_el_salvadoran_discusses_remittances_i_have/

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/09/el-salvador-bitcoin-move-could-cost-western-union-400-million-a-year.html

In 2020, El Salvador received nearly $6 billion in remittances, which accounted for about 23% of its gross domestic product.President Nayib Bukele estimates that money services providers like Western Union and MoneyGram will lose $400 million a year in commissions for remittances, thanks to the country’s bitcoin adoption.Some 70% of the Salvadoran population receives remittance payments.

Jaime García really hates using Western Union to send money home to El Salvador. 

“In this day and age, it is wild that I had to go to a physical Western Union office, give them actual cash, and then hand them another $25 on top of that, before they would send my money over,” García said.

“And then, of course, it takes three days for it to actually arrive in El Salvador.”

García, who lives in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, fled El Salvador when he was 11 after rebels bombed his house. His biggest issue with wiring cash abroad is less the inconvenience on his end and more about what happens to his loved ones receiving the money.

“They have to take a bus to go to a physical location to pick it up, and there are gangs that hang out around those offices. They know what people are going there for, and they basically rob them,” said García, who leads a team of researchers at SGI Canada Insurance. 

Since he last sent money home, García told CNBC, he now has the option to make an online payment via the Western Union app, but he still faces steep fees – 12.5% for a $100 transfer – and it doesn’t solve the problem of what happens to those picking up the cash in El Salvador.";28;0;https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/pl2lcr/el_salvadors_new_bitcoin_wallets_could_cost/

I wish I listened to him he was definitely right lol. He has been putting a good amount of his checks each week into btc. A few months ago he became ill and his last few weeks were not looking so good. He told me he wanted me to have his bitcoin savings since I was like a son to him. He was telling me for weeks to make a wallet so he can transfer some to me.


I kept pushing it off because I wanted him to focus on fighting and didn't want to think if him passing. Well unfortunately about 3 weeks ago he passed. There is no sign of even where to find his wallet or sign ins etc. His sister who he hated has claimed basic everything he had and has told me there needs to be no communication between us. 

As sad as this is turning out to he I made a block chain wallet today. Couldn't add funds to it get for some reason so bought $97 worth of bitcoin on Robinhood today in his mer. Its all I can afford right now, I don't make a lot of money. Not sure the difference between Robin hood and blockchain but from what I read on here I should avoid robinhood? I am going to move my money to block chain once I get verified. And I will try to put a little bit each week or month like he told me to do. Wanted to share that story.
